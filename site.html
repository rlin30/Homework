  What do you think of when someone says the word Otter? Words like adorable would probably come up at first. Or maybe words like predator, playful, sea, river, etc. Some might think that the Otter is just an adorable predator, which it is, but the otter is more than just an adorable weasel. In fact, it is the only weasel to live in water and, for some species, land. The design of an otter is even more perplexing. Since lives in the water, it has fur that can keep in heat, but the small body of the creature and the absence of blubber or fat is very different compared to other water hunters like the killer whale. However, their fur is the thickest of all mammals. Are you now interested in otters? Well either way here are some otter facts!

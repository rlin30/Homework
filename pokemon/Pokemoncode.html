    My experience with Pokemon is a good one. I have always liked video games. I found them very entertaining and pokemon is no different. I watched part of the anime growing up, and I had pokemon cards as well. However, I didn't really get how to play. I had played the game before and I find it to be fun. The only pokemon I really know are the early generations like generation 1. I would usually have Gengar, Charizard, Garyardos, Dragonite, and Arcanine along with anonther fighting pokemon like Hitmonchan because they were usually good and I considered them to be cool. For example, I think Gengar can use hypnosis and dream eater, which are both good moves, and that can heal and do a lot of damage. I liked to use dragon type pokemon like Charizard because dragon attacks are usually good. My favorite pokemon in this generation would be Arcanine because it just looks cool. It looks like a big, fluffy and cool wolf. I don't play the games much these days, but I would like to get back into it because it was fun. </p>

  <h1> My Top 10 Pokemon </h1>
  <h2> Richard Lin </h2>
  <p>
My top 10 pokemon recommendations to use base on stats and a bit of bias would be Gengar, Dragonite, Gyarados, Charizard, Arcanine, Aerodactyl, Machamp, Golem, Snorlax, and Hitmonlee. I chose these pokemons because they all have good damage, speed, or both. What I value as when I play pokemon is the ability to just destroy things. I don't care too much for status effect because they just seem tedious to me. Besides that point, these are really good pokemon based on their stats and overall stats. Some of these pokemon are tanky and can do a truck load of damage, and some of these pokemon don't have as much health but they have speed to make up for it. I could go further into this and explain the certain moves these pokemon have that make them destructive monsters, but one can easily tell by their stats that it is no question that these pokemon are one of the top tier pokemon. </p>

<Title> Otters Today </Title> <h1> Otters Today </h1>
  <body> <p> Today, <a href=https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jwmg.21685> Otter population </a>, although somewhat stable, isn't as high as it was previously. This is due to Otters beinng hunted by people for their pelts and other health
concerns like harmful pesticides being dumped into the water. However, with the introduction of the 1911 Fur Seal Treaty, the Otters were protected. However, the 
population of the Otters has plumetted so much that such a treaty seemed late and useless since the poaching of Otters was not profitable due to their low population.
Though some are hunted by people, other Otters help people hunt for fish. People in Southern Bangladesh have trained Otters to help hunt fish by setting out nets and 
    having the otters drive the fish into the nets for capture. </p>
